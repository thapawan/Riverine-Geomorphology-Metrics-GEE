# Riverine-Geomorphology-Metrics-GEE
This repository contains the code for a comprehensive analysis of riverine geomorphology. The project uses satellite imagery from the Landsat and Sentinel missions to calculate a range of hydraulic, geometric, and environmental metrics for key river segments over a 25-year period (2000â€“2024).
